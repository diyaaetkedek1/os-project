this Project is for the Operating Systems Course in Palistine Polytechnic University 
supervised by Dr.Hani Salah 

the project simulates 3 CPU algorithms:
1. Farst Come First Served
2. Round Robin
3. Shortast Remaning Time.

in the project file there is a processes.txt file and the file contains the Round Robin Quantum(Q), the context Switch time, The processes with there arrival time and CPU Burst time

if any problem accures in the processes file just ancomment the comment in the main method and whenever things back to normal recomment the comment !
